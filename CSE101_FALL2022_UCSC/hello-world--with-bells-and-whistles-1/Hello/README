-----------------------------------------------------

Code files: Makefile, hello.cpp, utils.cpp, utils.h
Test files: test-input1.txt, test-input2.txt, ideal-output1.txt, ideal-output2.txt
Extra files: README, hello-instr.pdf

----------------------------------------------------

This is a simple test assignment, to understand the overall pipeline we will follow
in our assignments. Look into hello-instr.pdf for more detailed instructions.

----------------------------------------------------

USAGE: 
1) Run "make", to get executable "hello".
2) Run "./hello <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>"

Each line of INPUT FILE should have a non-negative integer. (If a line does not have such an integer, it is interpreted as zero.)
Each corresponding line of OUTPUT FILE has "Hello world", printed that many times (with a space in between).
