Disclaimer: I am resubmitting this assignment after seeing that I had 
access to my code from my last time I took this course, I simply copied
that code, that is why most of the code is copy pasted. I mentioned this 
to Eren who said it fell under logical errors.

Description

The folder Bard contains the source and header files 
for a linkedlist ADT which has a few functions to handle 
the sorting of words in text files by length and rank. 
The bard.cpp source file uses the linkedlist ADT to create 
an executable file, bard, which handles formatted input and 
output files.

The insert function in linkedlist.cpp was made to sort rank
using the data element freq and sorting lexicographically.
bard.cpp creates a LinkedList array which is a series of LinkedLists
separated by length.


Files

Executable:
- bard
Source:
- bard.cpp
- linkedlist.cpp
Header:
- linkedlist.h
Testing:
- testclient.cpp (used for personal testing of linkedlist.cpp)
Text:
- input.txt/output.cpp (used by testclient.cpp)
- simple-input.txt/simple-outpt.txt, more-input.txt/more-output.txt (class provided txt files for testing bard.cpp
Makefile 


Usage
1. run "make," to get executable "bard"
2. run "./bard <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>"
To use testclient, the Makefile was edited to handle it

Citations:
Used Sesh's LinkedList code for print, find, and length functions as well as
for defining Node struct and LinkedList class.
