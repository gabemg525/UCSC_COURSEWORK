nqueens.cpp
Description:
The file nqueens.cpp has two main helper functions which are used to
solve the NQueens problem. The findQueenRows function takes a string
from a line of the input file and outputs a stack representing the columns
and rows representing a solution of the problem. The function uses stack
recursion to iterate through all permutations of the Queen positions by 
iterating through all permutations of rows until a solution is found. 
The validInsert function validates whether the positioning of the next 
row for the next permutation is valid.

Executable:
- nqueens
