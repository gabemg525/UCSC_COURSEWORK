wordrange.cpp
Description:
Inserts the string portion of lines from an input file into a lexicographically self-balancing AVL tree. Outputs line by
line the amount of nodes in the tree with values that are between two entries from the input file line.

bst.cpp
Lexicographically self-balancing AVL tree. Upon insertions, Nodes are rotated accordingly to maintain balance. Additionally,
the subtree sizes and heights at each Node affected by rotations are adjusted with each rotation. Ranges are calculated by 
accessing subtree sizes which allows any range to be found in O(logn) time.

 Includes a function to print the tree in level order for testing.

Executable:
- wordrange
