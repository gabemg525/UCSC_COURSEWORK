Error in output generation. Your program is wrong on a test case. Specifically, mismatch at line 1. (Line numbers start at 0.)
In output file, /home/codio/workspace/WordrangeStudent/my_output.txt, generated by your program, line is: 1

In correct output file, line is: 0


 There should be a test file (it's name is probably my_test.txt). That is the test case that failed.
