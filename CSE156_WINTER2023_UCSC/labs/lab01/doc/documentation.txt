Test Cases
- placed test print statements after each block of code, 5 total,
    checking that each block would run
- ran "./bin/myweb www.example.com 93.184.216.34/index.html" to test that
    default port GET request works
- ran GET request and HEAD request on pudim.br.com to test another server
- used "curl www.example.com > bin/curl_output" and compared curl_output
    and the output of myweb by running "diff curl_output output.dat" in 
    the bin directory
- placed error checks to see if socket functions were working
- Don't have a test case for different ports, only for port 80
